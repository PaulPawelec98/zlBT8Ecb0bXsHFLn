## Overview

This project is designed to facilitate HR talent search by leveraging data science techniques. It aims to streamline the process of identifying and evaluating potential candidates through data-driven methodologies.
Dataset

The repository includes datasets pertinent to HR analytics. Notably:

    eval_data.json: Contains evaluation data used for model assessment.

    user.json: Comprises user-related data essential for training and validation processes.

Note: Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations when handling and sharing these datasets.

Installation

To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/PaulPawelec98/zlBT8Ecb0bXsHFLn.git
cd zlBT8Ecb0bXsHFLn

Create and activate a virtual environment:

Using Conda:

conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate apzivaproject3

Or using requirements.txt:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the main script:

    python main.py

Ensure that all dependencies are properly installed and the environment is activated before running the scripts.
